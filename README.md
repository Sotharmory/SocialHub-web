- **Postman** - For API testing
- **MongoDB Compass** - GUI for MongoDB

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux Ubuntu 18.04+
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space

## Database Setup

### MongoDB Installation & Configuration

1. **Install MongoDB Community Edition**
   ```bash
   # On macOS with Homebrew
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community
   
   # On Windows
   # Download from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
   
   # On Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
   ```

2. **Start MongoDB Service**
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
   
   # On Windows
   net start MongoDB
   
   # On Linux
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

3. **Create Database**
   ```bash
   mongosh
   use aley_social_media
   db.createCollection("users")
   db.createCollection("posts")
   db.createCollection("messages")
   ```

4. **Set up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in root directory
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aley_social_media
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   ```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. MongoDB Connection Error
```
Error: MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server
```
**Solution:**
- Ensure MongoDB service is running
- Check if port 27017 is available
- Verify MONGODB_URI in .env file

#### 2. Angular CLI Not Found
```
ng: command not found
```
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

#### 3. Port Already in Use
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4200
```
**Solution:**
```bash
ng serve --port 4201
# or kill the process using the port
lsof -ti:4200 | xargs kill -9
```

#### 4. Node Modules Issues
```
Module not found errors
```
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### 5. JWT Token Expired
